# Phase 02: Test Framework Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Harden the test framework so it is portable, non-destructive, and machine-readable — configurable server/domain, JSON reporting, no auto-teardown on success, and a static workflow validator.
**Verified:** 2026-05-22
**Status:** human_needed
**Re-verification:** Yes — after gap closure

## Re-verification Summary

**Previous status:** gaps_found (6/7)
**Gap closed:** TEST-02 — `write_report()` passed `"$STAGING_DOMAIN"` unguarded. Line 91 now reads `"${STAGING_DOMAIN:-}"`. Confirmed by simulation: early-exit path now writes a valid JSON report with `staging_domain: ""` instead of crashing with "unbound variable".
**Regressions:** None — all previously-passing truths still pass.

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Operator can run `bash test/e2e.sh` and staging app remains running after successful exit | ? HUMAN NEEDED | All 9 steps present; conditional teardown guard wired correctly at line 183; requires live server to confirm |
| 2 | JSON report written to `test/results/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` on every run (pass or fail) | ✓ VERIFIED | Success path: verified. Early-failure path: simulation confirmed report is written with `staging_domain: ""` after fix at line 91 (`${STAGING_DOMAIN:-}`) |
| 3 | `E2E_SERVER=other-server bash test/e2e.sh` runs against that server with no script edits | ✓ VERIFIED | `E2E_SERVER="${E2E_SERVER:-vultr-stream}"` at line 43; `SERVER_ALIAS="$E2E_SERVER"` fallback at line 250; `--server` flag sets `SERVER_ALIAS` before fallback runs |
| 4 | `E2E_BASE_DOMAIN=foo.example.com` produces staging URL `<project>-staging.foo.example.com` | ✓ VERIFIED | `E2E_BASE_DOMAIN="${E2E_BASE_DOMAIN:-cicd.streamlinity.com}"` at line 44; `STAGING_DOMAIN="${TEST_PROJECT}-staging.${E2E_BASE_DOMAIN}"` at line 335 |
| 5 | Success prints `═══` bordered summary with staging URL, report path, and cleanup command | ✓ VERIFIED | Lines 541-550: bordered "Deployment complete" block with Staging URL, Production URL, Report path, and `bash test/cleanup-deployment.sh $REPORT_FILE` |
| 6 | Failed run still writes a report and runs cleanup teardown unless `--keep` is set | ✓ VERIFIED | Teardown block intact; simulation of early-exit (STAGING_DOMAIN never set) now produces valid JSON report |
| 7 | `bash test/validate-workflow.sh <valid.yml>` exits 0; broken needs exits 1 with correct message | ✓ VERIFIED | All 5 behaviour checks pass; syntax OK |

**Score:** 7/7 truths verified (1 requires live-server human confirmation)

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `test/e2e.sh` | E2E test runner with non-destructive success path, JSON reporting, env var configuration, completion summary | ✓ VERIFIED | Exists, 554 lines, substantive, all features wired; gap fixed at line 91 |
| `test/results/` | Output directory for JSON test reports (created at runtime) | ✓ VERIFIED | Not pre-created (correct — `mkdir -p` in `write_report()` creates it at runtime) |
| `test/validate-workflow.sh` | Standalone static validator for GitHub Actions workflow YAML | ✓ VERIFIED | Exists, 81 lines, substantive, all behaviour checks pass |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|-----|--------|---------|
| `test/e2e.sh` main body | `test/results/${TIMESTAMP}.json` | `python3` inline JSON dump | ✓ WIRED | `write_report()` called at line 536; `json.dump` writes to `$REPORT_FILE`; path set to `$report_dir/${TIMESTAMP}.json` |
| `cleanup()` function | exit_code == 0 branch | conditional skip-teardown guard | ✓ WIRED | `if [ "$exit_code" -eq 0 ]` at line 183; correct block order: KEEP_ON_EXIT → exit_code==0 → step "Cleanup" |
| `cleanup()` trap path | `write_report()` | `write_report \|\| true` at line 144 | ✓ WIRED | Called before teardown decision; `${STAGING_DOMAIN:-}` guard at line 91 now prevents nounset crash |
| Configuration section | STAGING_DOMAIN/PROD_DOMAIN construction | E2E_BASE_DOMAIN variable substitution | ✓ WIRED | Lines 335-336: both domain lines use `${E2E_BASE_DOMAIN}` |
| `test/validate-workflow.sh` | `python3 yaml.safe_load` | inline Python heredoc | ✓ WIRED | `<<'PY'` heredoc at lines 33-43 |
| `needs:` extraction | defined-jobs set | set membership check | ✓ WIRED | `defined = set(jobs.keys())` at line 54; `dep not in defined` at line 67 |

### Data-Flow Trace (Level 4)

| Artifact | Data Variable | Source | Produces Real Data | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------|--------------------|--------|
| `test/e2e.sh` write_report() | `STAGING_DOMAIN` | Line 335 in main body (Step 3) | Yes on success path; `""` on early failure | ✓ FLOWING — `${STAGING_DOMAIN:-}` at line 91 prevents crash; empty string written to JSON on early-exit paths |
| `test/e2e.sh` write_report() | `COOLIFY_PROJECT_UUID`, `STG_APP_UUID`, `PRD_APP_UUID` | Steps 5 provision.sh output | Yes (uses `${VAR:-}` defaults) | ✓ FLOWING — all three use `:-` default |
| `test/e2e.sh` write_report() | `RESULTS` | `pass()`/`fail()` accumulation | Yes | ✓ FLOWING — safe-array expansion `${RESULTS[@]+"${RESULTS[@]}"}` handles empty array |
| `test/validate-workflow.sh` | `jobs` dict | `yaml.safe_load(f)` of YAML_FILE arg | Yes | ✓ FLOWING — reads live file, no hardcoded data |

### Behavioral Spot-Checks

| Behavior | Command | Result | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| validate-workflow.sh valid YAML exits 0 | `bash test/validate-workflow.sh <tmpfile>` | exit 0, prints OK lines | ✓ PASS |
| validate-workflow.sh broken string needs exits 1 | `bash test/validate-workflow.sh <tmpfile>` | exit 1, correct FAIL message | ✓ PASS |
| validate-workflow.sh broken list needs exits 1 | `bash test/validate-workflow.sh <tmpfile>` | exit 1, flags ghost dep | ✓ PASS |
| validate-workflow.sh no args exits 1 | `bash test/validate-workflow.sh` | exit 1, Usage message | ✓ PASS |
| validate-workflow.sh nonexistent file exits 1 | `bash test/validate-workflow.sh /nonexistent.yml` | exit 1, ERROR: file not found | ✓ PASS |
| e2e.sh syntax | `bash -n test/e2e.sh` | exit 0 | ✓ PASS |
| validate-workflow.sh syntax | `bash -n test/validate-workflow.sh` | exit 0 | ✓ PASS |
| write_report() early-fail scenario (STAGING_DOMAIN unset) | simulated bash script with `${STAGING_DOMAIN:-}` fix | JSON report written, no crash | ✓ PASS |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| TEST-01 | 02-01-PLAN.md | E2E flow unchanged — Steps 1-9 still execute | ? NEEDS HUMAN | All 9 steps present in e2e.sh; wiring intact; requires live server run |
| TEST-02 | 02-01-PLAN.md | JSON report written on every run with 7 required fields | ✓ SATISFIED | Success path: all 7 keys verified. Failure path: simulation confirms report written after `${STAGING_DOMAIN:-}` fix at line 91 |
| TEST-03 | 02-01-PLAN.md | No auto-teardown on success | ✓ SATISFIED | `if [ "$exit_code" -eq 0 ]` guard in cleanup() at line 183; block order correct; teardown block intact for failure path |
| TEST-04 | 02-01-PLAN.md | E2E_SERVER + E2E_BASE_DOMAIN configurable; --server overrides E2E_SERVER | ✓ SATISFIED | Env vars defined with defaults; domain construction parameterised; arg parse precedes fallback |
| TEST-05 | 02-01-PLAN.md | Bordered completion summary on success | ✓ SATISFIED | `═══` bordered "Deployment complete" block with all required fields at lines 541-550 |
| VALID-01 | 02-02-PLAN.md | yaml.safe_load syntax check | ✓ SATISFIED | Implemented; all behaviour checks pass |
| VALID-02 | 02-02-PLAN.md | needs: reference resolution | ✓ SATISFIED | Implemented with string + list form handling; all behaviour checks pass |

No orphaned requirements — all 7 IDs claimed by plans and mapped to implementations.

### Anti-Patterns Found

None. The previously reported BLOCKER (`"$STAGING_DOMAIN"` unguarded at line 91) has been resolved. No new anti-patterns found.

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Full E2E Success Run

**Test:** Run `bash test/e2e.sh` against the configured Coolify server
**Expected:** All 9 steps complete, `test/results/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` written with 7 fields, staging + production apps remain running after script exits 0, bordered "Deployment complete" summary printed
**Why human:** Requires live Coolify server, authenticated Doppler CLI, and real HTTPS DNS resolution

#### 2. E2E_SERVER/E2E_BASE_DOMAIN Override

**Test:** `E2E_SERVER=alternate-server E2E_BASE_DOMAIN=ci.example.com bash test/e2e.sh --keep`
**Expected:** Script connects to alternate-server, constructs staging URL as `<project>-staging.ci.example.com`
**Why human:** Requires a second server alias in `~/.claude/coolify.json`

### Gaps Summary

No gaps remain. The single confirmed code defect from the initial verification (TEST-02) has been fixed. All 7 requirements are satisfied at the static analysis level. The only open items are live-server confirmations (TEST-01 and TEST-04 override path) that cannot be verified without running against real infrastructure.
