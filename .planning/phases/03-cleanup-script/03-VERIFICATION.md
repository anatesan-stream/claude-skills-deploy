# Phase 03: Cleanup Script Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Operators can delete the hello-world Coolify project and apps created by an E2E run by passing the test report file to a cleanup script — completing the full provision → verify → teardown loop
**Verified:** 2026-05-22
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| #  | Truth                                                                                                              | Status     | Evidence                                                                                 |
|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Operator can run `bash test/cleanup-deployment.sh <report-file>` with no other flags                              | VERIFIED   | Arg parser only accepts positional path; rejects unknown `--` flags                      |
| 2  | Script deletes the Coolify staging app whose UUID is recorded in the report file                                   | VERIFIED   | Line 75: `coolify_curl DELETE "/applications/$STAGING_APP_UUID"`                        |
| 3  | Script deletes the Coolify production app whose UUID is recorded in the report file                                | VERIFIED   | Line 79: `coolify_curl DELETE "/applications/$PRODUCTION_APP_UUID"`                     |
| 4  | Script deletes the Coolify project whose UUID is recorded in the report file                                       | VERIFIED   | Line 85: `coolify_curl DELETE "/projects/$COOLIFY_PROJECT_UUID"`                        |
| 5  | Script removes Docker volumes `${uuid}-doppler-cache` for both apps via SSH                                        | VERIFIED   | Lines 91-96: loop over both UUIDs, `ssh "$SSH_HOST" "docker volume rm ${uuid}-doppler-cache"` |
| 6  | Script deletes the Doppler project named in the report file                                                        | VERIFIED   | Line 100: `doppler projects delete "$DOPPLER_PROJECT" --yes`                            |
| 7  | Script prints a confirmation block listing project name, staging app UUID, production app UUID, Doppler project    | VERIFIED   | Lines 107-115: "Cleanup complete" block with all four identifiers                       |
| 8  | Script exits non-zero with clear error when report file is missing, malformed, or missing required fields — before any DELETE | VERIFIED   | All four smoke tests pass: Passed 4 / Failed 0                                          |
| 9  | Script continues past partial failures (404s, unreachable resources) with a warning per resource                  | VERIFIED   | Every DELETE and `ssh` call uses `|| echo "⚠ ..."` warn-and-continue pattern            |

**Score:** 9/9 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact                        | Expected                                      | Status     | Details                                                                                             |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `test/cleanup-deployment.sh`    | Self-contained teardown script for E2E deploys | VERIFIED   | Exists, 118 lines, executable bit set, bash -n clean, sources both libs via `$SKILL_DIR`, five-step deletion sequence present |

**Level 1 (Exists):** File present at `test/cleanup-deployment.sh`
**Level 2 (Substantive):** 118 lines; contains `coolify_curl DELETE "/applications/`, `doppler projects delete`; no TODO/placeholder markers; `bash -n` exits 0
**Level 3 (Wired):** Sources `lib-coolify-api.sh` and `lib-doppler-api.sh`; all five deletion targets present; validation guard at top before any DELETE

### Key Link Verification

| From                          | To                         | Via                                               | Status   | Details                                                      |

### Data-Flow Trace (Level 4)

Not applicable — this is a teardown script, not a data-rendering component. It reads a JSON report file and issues API calls; no dynamic data is rendered beyond echoed UUID values extracted from the report.

### Behavioral Spot-Checks

| Behavior                              | Command                                       | Result                           | Status |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------|
| No-arg exits non-zero with named error | `bash test/cleanup-deployment.sh 2>&1`        | "ERROR: report file path required" | PASS   |
| Non-existent file exits non-zero       | `bash test/cleanup-deployment.sh /tmp/nope...` | "ERROR: report file not found:"  | PASS   |
| Malformed JSON exits non-zero          | bad JSON temp file                            | "ERROR: invalid JSON in report file:" | PASS |
| Missing fields exits non-zero          | partial JSON temp file                        | "ERROR: report file missing fields:" | PASS  |
| Bash syntax valid                      | `bash -n test/cleanup-deployment.sh`          | exit 0                           | PASS   |
| Executable bit set                     | `test -x test/cleanup-deployment.sh`          | exit 0                           | PASS   |

All smoke tests: Passed 4 / Failed 0

Live end-to-end execution (with a real Coolify server and a report file from `test/e2e.sh`) cannot be verified programmatically — see Human Verification Required below.

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan    | Description                                                                                         | Status    | Evidence                                                                              |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CLEAN-01    | 03-01-PLAN.md  | Operator can run `bash test/cleanup-deployment.sh <report-file>` to delete Coolify project and apps | SATISFIED | Three `coolify_curl DELETE` calls for staging app, production app, and project; UUIDs extracted from report file |
| CLEAN-02    | 03-01-PLAN.md  | `cleanup-deployment.sh` prints confirmation of what it deleted (project name, app names, UUIDs) and exits 0 on success | SATISFIED | Lines 107-115: "Cleanup complete" block lists `Coolify project:`, `Staging app UUID:`, `Production app UUID:`, `Doppler project:`; `exit 0` on line 117 |

Both CLEAN-01 and CLEAN-02 are the only requirements mapped to Phase 3 in REQUIREMENTS.md. Both are satisfied. No orphaned requirements.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File                          | Pattern                     | Severity | Impact                  |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|-------------------------|
| (none)                        | —                           | —        | —                       |

- `grep -c '\bjq\b'` = 0 (no jq; uses python3 for JSON)
- `grep -c 'dry-run'` = 0 (no --dry-run flag)
- `grep -E 'source\s+\./'` = (nothing — uses `$SKILL_DIR/scripts/`)
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder/`return null`/`return {}` patterns found
- No hardcoded empty arrays/objects in any rendering path

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Live teardown with a real Coolify server

**Test:** Run `test/e2e.sh` against a live Coolify + Doppler server to produce a real `test/results/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` report file, then run `bash test/cleanup-deployment.sh <report-file>`.
**Expected:** Script deletes all five resources (staging app, production app, Coolify project, two Docker volumes, Doppler project) and prints the "Cleanup complete" confirmation block. All five resources are absent from the Coolify UI and Doppler dashboard after the script exits 0.
**Why human:** Requires a live Coolify server, authenticated Doppler CLI, and SSH access to a VPS with Docker. Cannot be verified without real infrastructure.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps. All truths verified, all artifacts substantive and wired, both requirements satisfied, all smoke tests pass.

The only outstanding item is the live integration test (human verification above), which is gated on Phase 2 having produced a real report file against actual infrastructure — this is an expected and documented dependency, not a gap in the cleanup script itself.
