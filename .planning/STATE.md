# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-21)

**Core value:** A developer can clone this repo, run one command, see a working hello-world deployment on their Coolify server, and trust the skill is correct before using it for a real application.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — test-framework

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Fix HIGH bugs before building test framework — E2E test would fail for wrong reasons otherwise
- Roadmap: No auto-cleanup in E2E test — new users need to see the deployed result
- Roadmap: Static workflow validation instead of live GitHub Actions run
- [Phase 01-bug-fixes]: D-01: needs: [smoke-staging] → needs: [deploy-staging] — smoke test is a step inside deploy-staging, not a separate job
- [Phase 01-bug-fixes]: D-02: smoke test URL / → /api/health — aligns with Coolify health_check_path set in provision.sh
- [Phase 01-bug-fixes]: D-03: Loop all env_var keys before exiting — accumulate all failures then raise SystemExit
- [Phase 01-bug-fixes]: D-04: Per-key error format: ERROR: doppler secrets get KEY_NAME failed: <stderr>
- [Phase 01-bug-fixes]: D-06: Read optional server_name from coolify.json with 'localhost' default — same python3 json.load pattern as ssh_host
- [Phase 01-bug-fixes]: D-07: Document server_name in Optional Fields subsection and Backward Compatibility section following ssh_host migration block pattern
- [Phase 02-test-framework]: Inline Python heredoc with single-quoted PY marker prevents bash variable expansion in Python f-strings
- [Phase 02-test-framework]: VALID-02 error accumulation: collect all broken needs refs before exiting, matching validate.sh convention
- [Phase 02-test-framework]: E2E_SERVER env var replaces python3 coolify.json first-server fallback — simpler and explicit
- [Phase 02-test-framework]: write_report() called idempotently from main body and cleanup() to ensure report written on both pass and fail paths

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 02.1 inserted after Phase 2: new-user-onboarding (URGENT) — review identified 8 issues: hardcoded streamlinity domain values in scripts that silently fail for new users, stale docs, and missing "new domain quick start" guidance

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: CONCERNS.md notes a fallback CREATE endpoint body mismatch (MEDIUM severity) — not blocking but may surface during E2E test execution
- Phase 2: E2E test (`test/e2e.sh`) exists but has never been run against real infrastructure — unknown unknowns possible
