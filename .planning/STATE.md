# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-21)

**Core value:** A developer can clone this repo, run one command, see a working hello-world deployment on their Coolify server, and trust the skill is correct before using it for a real application.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — bug-fixes

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (bug-fixes) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Fix HIGH bugs before building test framework — E2E test would fail for wrong reasons otherwise
- Roadmap: No auto-cleanup in E2E test — new users need to see the deployed result
- Roadmap: Static workflow validation instead of live GitHub Actions run
- [Phase 01-bug-fixes]: D-01: needs: [smoke-staging] → needs: [deploy-staging] — smoke test is a step inside deploy-staging, not a separate job
- [Phase 01-bug-fixes]: D-02: smoke test URL / → /api/health — aligns with Coolify health_check_path set in provision.sh
- [Phase 01-bug-fixes]: D-03: Loop all env_var keys before exiting — accumulate all failures then raise SystemExit
- [Phase 01-bug-fixes]: D-04: Per-key error format: ERROR: doppler secrets get KEY_NAME failed: <stderr>

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: CONCERNS.md notes a fallback CREATE endpoint body mismatch (MEDIUM severity) — not blocking but may surface during E2E test execution
- Phase 2: E2E test (`test/e2e.sh`) exists but has never been run against real infrastructure — unknown unknowns possible
