# Per-Domain Setup Guide

A complete walkthrough from blank VPS to a working Coolify + Doppler CI/CD pipeline.
Follow these steps once per Coolify instance (i.e., once per domain/org). After this
guide is complete, run `bash init/init.sh` in any target repo to bootstrap it.

---

## Overview

This guide covers the one-time infrastructure setup required before you can run
`/setup-coolify` on any repo. You will: stand up a Coolify instance, generate an API
token, add an SSH alias, configure Doppler, populate `~/.claude/coolify.json`, wire up
GitHub Actions secrets, and finally bootstrap + provision your first repo.

The reference implementation is skillmap on Vultr (IP `149.248.4.46`) using Doppler
workspace `streamlinity` and Coolify at `https://coolify.cicd.streamlinity.com`. Replace
these values with your own throughout.

---

## DNS setup

All DNS records must exist before you enable HTTPS on Coolify (Step 1) or deploy any
application. Provision your VPS first (Step 1, items 1–3), note its public IP, then
create the records below before continuing.

### Records to create

| Purpose | Type | Name | Value | Notes |
|---------|------|------|-------|-------|
| Coolify dashboard | A | `coolify.<your-domain>` | `<vps-ip>` | Used by Let's Encrypt and for browser access to the Coolify UI |
| Deployed app — staging | A | `*.<base-domain>` | `<vps-ip>` | Wildcard covers all `<app>-staging.<base-domain>` subdomains that Coolify creates |
| Deployed app — production | A | `<app>.<your-domain>` | `<vps-ip>` | One record per production app; add these as you provision apps |
| E2E test subdomains | — | (covered by wildcard) | — | The `csd-e2e-*-staging.<base-domain>` throwaway domains used by `test/e2e.sh` resolve automatically if the wildcard is in place |

### Reference implementation

For `streamlinity.com` on Vultr IP `149.248.4.46`:

```
coolify.cicd.streamlinity.com   A   149.248.4.46   # Coolify dashboard + API
*.cicd.streamlinity.com         A   149.248.4.46   # wildcard for all deployed app subdomains
skillmap.cicd.streamlinity.com  A   149.248.4.46   # production app (explicit, or covered by wildcard)
```

> **Wildcard vs. explicit records:** A wildcard (`*.<base-domain>`) covers staging,
> E2E test throwaway subdomains, and any new apps automatically. Most DNS providers
> support wildcard A records. If yours does not, you will need to add an explicit A record
> for each app subdomain (`<app>-staging.<base-domain>`, `<app>-production.<base-domain>`)
> before Coolify can issue a TLS certificate for it.

### DNS propagation

Let's Encrypt HTTP-01 challenges require the A record to resolve from the public internet
before certificate issuance will succeed. After creating records, verify propagation:

```bash
dig +short coolify.<your-domain>          # should return <vps-ip>
dig +short anything.cicd.<your-domain>    # should return <vps-ip> (wildcard check)
```

Allow up to 10 minutes for propagation on most providers (Cloudflare is typically
near-instant). Do not proceed to Step 1 item 5 (enabling HTTPS) until both resolve.

---

## Step 1: Stand up a Coolify instance

**Recommended VPS providers:** Vultr, Hetzner, AWS EC2. A $6–12/mo VPS (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM)
is sufficient for most workloads. Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is the tested base image.

1. Provision a new VPS, note its public IP.
2. SSH in as root:
   ```bash
   ssh root@<ip>
   ```
3. Install Coolify:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | sudo bash
   ```
   This installs Docker, Coolify, and sets up systemd. The install takes 2–5 minutes.
4. Once the install completes, open `http://<ip>:8000` in a browser. Create your admin
   account on the first-run wizard.
5. Enable HTTPS: navigate to Coolify **Settings → Configuration → HTTPS** and follow the
   prompts to issue a Let's Encrypt certificate for your Coolify domain. You will need a
   DNS A record pointing to the VPS IP first (e.g., `coolify.cicd.example.com → <ip>`).

**Post-install: clear `allowed_ips`**

By default Coolify may restrict API access to specific IPs. Before API calls from
GitHub Actions (or your local machine) will work, open Coolify **Settings → Security**
and clear `allowed_ips` (set to `*` or your known IP ranges). Leaving this at the
default value causes every API call to return HTTP 403 even with a valid token.

---

## Step 2: Generate a Coolify API token

1. Log in to your Coolify dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Settings → Keys & Tokens → API Tokens**.
3. Click **Create Token**. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., `claude-skills-deploy`).
4. Scope: **read + write** (the skill needs write access to create/update apps).
5. **Copy the token immediately.** Coolify uses Laravel Sanctum which stores hashed tokens
   only — the plaintext is shown once at creation and cannot be retrieved later.
6. Store it temporarily in a secure note; you will paste it into `~/.claude/coolify.json`
   and into a GitHub Actions secret in steps below.

---

## Step 3: Create the SSH alias

The skill SSHes to your Coolify server to create persistent Docker volumes (Doppler
fallback cache). Add an alias to `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host my-coolify-server
  HostName <ip-address>
  User root
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Replace `my-coolify-server` with a memorable alias (e.g., `vultr-stream`,
`hetzner-strategem`). This alias is the value you set for `ssh_host` in
`~/.claude/coolify.json` and `server:` in `coolify.yaml`.

Confirm the alias works:
```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes my-coolify-server 'echo ok'
```
The output should be `ok`. If it times out, check the VPS firewall (port 22 must be
open) and that your public key is in `root@<ip>:~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

---

## Step 4: Set up Doppler

1. **Install the Doppler CLI:**
   ```bash
   curl -Ls --tlsv1.2 --proto "=https" https://cli.doppler.com/install.sh | sh
   doppler --version   # should be 3.76.0 or later
   ```

2. **Authenticate:**
   ```bash
   doppler login
   ```
   This opens a browser OAuth flow. Complete it and return to the terminal.

3. **Create a Doppler project** (one project per repo you deploy):
   ```bash
   doppler projects create <project-name>
   ```
   Or create via the Doppler dashboard at `dashboard.doppler.com`. Use a slug that
   matches your repo name (e.g., `skillmap`, `strategem-website`).

4. **Create the required configs.** Doppler uses "configs" for environments. The skill
   expects `stg` and `prd` configs (Doppler's actual defaults):
   ```bash
   # Doppler creates dev, dev_personal, stg, and prd by default for new projects.
   # Verify they exist:
   doppler configs --project <project-name>
   ```
   If `stg` or `prd` are absent, create them via the dashboard:
   Doppler → Your Project → Configs → Add Config.

5. **Seed secrets.** Every key listed in `env_vars` in your `coolify.yaml` must exist in
   both the `stg` and `prd` Doppler configs before `/setup-coolify validate` will pass:
   ```bash
   doppler secrets set --project <project-name> --config stg KEY=value
   doppler secrets set --project <project-name> --config prd KEY=value
   ```
   Repeat for every key your application needs (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`,
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`).

---

## Step 5: Configure ~/.claude/coolify.json

Create (or update) `~/.claude/coolify.json` with your server entry. You can write this file manually or generate it interactively.

**Option A: Interactive Flow (Recommended)**
Run:
```bash
/setup-coolify init
```
This prompts you for the server alias, URL, API key, Doppler account, and SSH host, then merges the new entry into `~/.claude/coolify.json` and automatically sets the correct permissions.

**Option B: Manual Setup**
Create the file at `~/.claude/coolify.json` using this format (see **[docs/schema.md](./schema.md#coolifyjson--machine-local-credentials)** for the canonical field reference and detailed description of each property):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "vultr-stream": {
      "url": "https://coolify.cicd.streamlinity.com",
      "api_key": "xOIN...",
      "doppler_account": "streamlinity",
      "ssh_host": "v_cicd_stream"
    }
  }
}
```

**Secure the file immediately:**
```bash
chmod 0600 ~/.claude/coolify.json
```

---

## Step 6: Set up the GitHub repo

The generated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` requires two GitHub Actions secrets:

1. **`COOLIFY_API_KEY`** — the Coolify API token from Step 2:
   ```bash
   gh secret set COOLIFY_API_KEY --body "<token>"
   ```

2. **`COOLIFY_URL`** — the Coolify instance root URL:
   ```bash
   gh secret set COOLIFY_URL --body "https://coolify.cicd.streamlinity.com"
   ```

3. **Enable GHCR write permission.** GitHub Actions needs permission to push Docker images
   to GHCR (GitHub Container Registry). In your repo settings:
   - Go to **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions**
   - Select **Read and write permissions**
   - Save.

   Or via CLI:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo} --method PATCH --field default_workflow_permissions=write
   ```

---

## Step 6b: Store GHCR_TOKEN for local E2E testing

The E2E test script (`test/e2e.sh`) needs to pull the hello-world test image from GHCR.
The image must be pushed once before the test can run. This requires a GitHub PAT with
`write:packages` scope stored in Doppler.

**Why Doppler, not an env var?** Any operator with access to the `claude-skills-deploy`
Doppler project can push the test image and run E2E tests without sharing secrets
out-of-band. The token is never committed.

**One-time setup:**

1. Create a GitHub PAT with `write:packages, read:packages, delete:packages` scopes at
   `https://github.com/settings/tokens/new`.

2. Store it in Doppler:
   ```bash
   doppler secrets set GHCR_TOKEN --project claude-skills-deploy --config stg
   ```

3. Push the hello-world test image (only needed once, or when `test/hello-world/` changes):
   ```bash
   bash test/push-hello-world.sh
   ```
   The script automatically reads `GHCR_TOKEN` from Doppler if it is not set in the
   environment.

**Alternative — CI push (no PAT required):** The `push-test-image.yml` workflow in this
repo builds and pushes the test image using `GITHUB_TOKEN` (no separate PAT). Run it
manually from GitHub Actions → "Push E2E Test Image" → Run workflow, or it triggers
automatically when `test/hello-world/` changes on `main`.

**Teardown safety:** `GHCR_TOKEN` lives in the `claude-skills-deploy` Doppler project.
E2E cleanup only deletes the throwaway test project (e.g., `csd-e2e-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`)
from Doppler — it never touches the `claude-skills-deploy` project or its secrets.

---

## Step 7: Bootstrap and provision

With all setup complete, bootstrap any target repo:

```bash
# Navigate to the repo root:
cd ~/development/<your-project>

# Run the bootstrapper (writes BOTH coolify.yaml AND .github/workflows/deploy.yml):
bash ~/.claude/skills/setup-coolify/init/init.sh
```

You will be prompted for:
- Project name (e.g., `skillmap`)
- Server alias (must match a key in `~/.claude/coolify.json`, e.g., `vultr-stream`)
- Doppler project slug (e.g., `skillmap`)
- GHCR registry image (e.g., `ghcr.io/anatesan-stream/ai-upskilling`)
- Staging domain (e.g., `skillmap-staging.cicd.streamlinity.com`)
- Production domain (e.g., `skillmap.cicd.streamlinity.com`)
- Build context (default `.`; set to `./skillmap` only for monorepos with a nested app)
- Dockerfile path (default `./Dockerfile`)
- Env var keys (space-separated list of all keys your app needs)

After the bootstrapper completes, validate and provision:
```bash
/setup-coolify validate    # dry-run: checks Doppler keys + Coolify API
/setup-coolify             # provisions staging + production apps (idempotent)
```

Commit and push the generated files:
```bash
git add coolify.yaml .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "ci: add Coolify deploy pipeline"
git push
```

---

## Step 8: Run the E2E integration test

The E2E test exercises the full skill end-to-end against your real infrastructure: it
creates a throwaway Coolify project + Doppler project, provisions staging and production
apps, deploys a hello-world container, and smoke-tests the live HTTPS URL. Run this once
after Step 7 to confirm your setup is correct before using the skill on a real repo.

See **[docs/test-environment.md](./test-environment.md)** for the full guide including
prerequisites (test image setup, required env vars), the run/inspect/cleanup workflow,
the report file format, and a troubleshooting table.

**Quick reference** (assuming Step 6b is complete):

```bash
# Run the test (~3-5 minutes)
E2E_SERVER=<alias> E2E_BASE_DOMAIN=<base-domain> bash test/e2e.sh

# Inspect: browse to the staging URL printed in the output

# Clean up when done
bash test/cleanup-deployment.sh test/results/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.json
```

---

## Verifying success

1. **Check the GitHub Actions workflow was registered:**
   ```bash
   gh workflow view Deploy --repo <org>/<repo>
   ```

2. **Trigger a test push.** Push any commit to `main`. The workflow runs:
   - Build Docker image → push to GHCR with `sha-<commit>` tag
   - Patch staging app → trigger staging deploy → smoke test (HTTP 200 on `/api/health`)
   - On smoke test green: patch production app → trigger production deploy

3. **Check Coolify UI.** Both apps (`<project>-staging` and `<project>-production`) should
   appear in the Coolify project with a green status indicator after the first deploy.

4. **Verify Doppler token injection.** In Coolify, open either app → Environment Variables.
   You should see `DOPPLER_TOKEN` set to a service token, plus all `env_vars` keys listed
   (with `DOPPLER_*` prefix from Coolify's display). The actual secret values are NOT
   stored in Coolify — they are pulled from Doppler at container start.

5. **Visit the staging URL** in a browser. The app should load without errors.

## Next Steps

- **Verify your pipeline:** Follow **[docs/test-environment.md](./test-environment.md)** to run the end-to-end integration tests on your new server.
- **Deploying to a different domain / organization?** Review the **[docs/fork-guide.md](./fork-guide.md)** to understand the clone vs. fork workflow for organization-wide custom templates.
